Introduction

In the evolving financial technology landscape, machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) are transforming banking services. However, these innovations bring unique challenges in security, privacy, and compliance that require robust testing frameworks.

The Hybrid Framework for Testing LLMs and ML Models is designed to fortify the security, reliability, and ethical integrity of AIdriven systems. It supports:
1. Data Protection and Compliance: Safeguarding customer data while adhering to regulations.
2. Resilience Against Threats: Ensuring robustness against adversarial and other malicious attacks.

This repository outlines the framework's structure and key principles, without disclosing detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to maintain proprietary integrity.


Framework Overview

The framework is divided into seven key checks that provide a comprehensive testing approach for both LLMs and ML models:

1. Data Privacy and Governance
 Ensures compliance with GDPR, SOX, and CCPA.
 Mitigates ethical risks such as discrimination and privacy violations.

Tools:  
LLMs: Presidio  
ML Models: Presidio  

References:  
NIST AI Framework, GDPR Standards, OWASP MLSVS  



2. Bias and Fairness Testing
 Identifies and mitigates training data biases.
 Promotes equitable and ethical AI behavior.

Tools:  
LLMs: TextAttack  
ML Models: AI Fairness 360  

References:  
OECD AI Principles, OWASP Top 10 for ML  



3. Adversarial Robustness
 Tests resistance to adversarial inputs targeting vulnerabilities.
 Essential for applications like fraud detection and risk assessment.

Tools:  
LLMs: Garak  
ML Models: Adversarial Robustness Toolkit (ART)  

References:  
Microsoft AI Security, OWASP Top 10 for ML  



4. Explainability and Interpretability
 Ensures transparency in decisionmaking.
 Builds trust by offering insights into model predictions.

Tools:  
LLMs: LIME for NLP  
ML Models: InterpretML  

References:  
NIST AI Explainability Principles  


5. Performance and Scalability Testing
 Evaluates response under typical and increased workloads.
 Critical for maintaining performance and user satisfaction.

Tools:  
LLMs: Apache JMeter  
ML Models: Locust  

References:  
Microsoft Impact AI Framework  



6. Operational Monitoring and Drift Detection
 Tracks realtime behavior and identifies data/model drift.
 Supports continuous improvement through stakeholder feedback.

Tools:  
LLMs: Giskard AI  
ML Models: Evidently AI  

References:  
NIST AI Framework, European Commissionâ€™s Trustworthy AI Guidelines  



7. Incident Response and Security Monitoring
 Proactively addresses security incidents like prompt injections.
 Continuously monitors behavior to detect anomalies and threats.

Tools:  
LLMs: Kibana  
ML Models: Splunk  

References:  
OWASP MLSVS, NIST Cybersecurity Framework  


Why This Framework?
This hybrid approach bridges the gap between conventional ML testing and the unique needs of LLMs. It is tailored for banking and financial services to uphold trust, compliance, and security standards.
